or by dowloading the spottedDesign.xd file from the Design folder and opening it in Adobe XD. 
(The link is much quicker, but opening it in XD allows you to play with the mockup and all of its fancy buttons etc.)

The app was written using Swift 3 and Xcode 8. 
Dev database/server hosted by Google Firebase.

To launch app simulator:
- In Xcode, launch SpottedOnCampus.xcworkspace, which can be found at spottedoncampus/SpottedOnCampus.xcworkspace.
- Ensure that an iOS device is selected from the list of simulators on the top bar of Xcode. Generic iOS Device will not work.
- Build and run.
