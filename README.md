# Spotted on Campus
Prototype of the Spotted on Campus iPhone app developed for Spotted, LLC.

Spotted On Campus is an app that provides college students with a connecting platform to list and rent clothing to and from their peers across campus. Spotted aims to bring college students what they want most: an extra $5 and a killer outfit. They spend so much money on clothing only to be worn one night out, posted in an Instagram, and then are never able to be worn again. Those clothes just sit in the back of our closets when there are likely other people on campus who would want to wear them and are willing to pay. Spotted gives students the opportunity to share a closet with the entire campus, and to make some extra money while they're at it.

or by dowloading the spottedDesign.xd file from the Design folder and opening it in Adobe XD. 
(The link is much quicker, but opening it in XD allows you to play with the mockup and all of its fancy buttons etc.)

The app was written using Swift 3 and Xcode 8. 
Dev database/server hosted by Google Firebase.

- In Xcode, launch SpottedOnCampus.xcworkspace, which can be found at spottedoncampus/SpottedOnCampus.xcworkspace.
